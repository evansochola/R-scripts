## Imports

```{r}
# This clears all objects in "global environment"
rm(list=ls())

# clears the console area
cat("\014")

# Sets R random numbers to start at the same sequence
set.seed(1234)

install.packages("readr")
install.packages("here")

library(readr)
library(here)
```

## Load Dataset

```{r}
Boston <- read_csv(here::here("data","raw","boston.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)
head(Boston)
```

## Splitting the Dataset

Split the dataset so that one unique proportion is used to train the model ("train dataset") and one unique set to test the model ("test dataset").

Randomise the dataset just in case it happens to be stored in some order that might impact the model building process; this is random sampling.

```{r}
rowsInDataFrame <- nrow(Boston)
randomNumbers <- runif(rowsInDataFrame) # vector of uniform random numbers between [0.0, 1.0]
randomIndexes <- order(randomNumbers) # creates a vector of 506 unique indexes
```

Use the unique random indexes to extract each row in the dataset in a random order:

```{r}
Boston <- Boston[randomIndexes,]

# Using 70% of the dataset to train the model
training_records <- round(nrow(Boston) * 70/100)
```

```{r}
# train and test sets with a single predictor variable
train_set <- Boston[1:training_records, c("lstat", "medv")]
test_set <- Boston[-(1:training_records), c("lstat", "medv")]
```

## Exploring and visualising datasets

```{r}
medv <-  train_set$medv
lstat <- train_set$lstat

print("Scatter plot two variables lstat and medv")
plot(lstat, medv, main = "Points from Training Dataset",
     ylab = "Median House Prices($)",
     xlab = "Lower Status(%)")
```

This does not look very linear. But as we"ll be using a simple linear regression model, the more linear we make the data, the better chance it has of learning a good predicting model.

The scatterplot does not tell us much about the relationship between the two variables. It would be easier to maybe spot a statistical shape.

If we order the predictor variable lstat and then plot again, we get a clearer picture of the relationship.

```{r}
print("Ordered plot of lstat")
plot(sort(lstat, decreasing = TRUE),
     main = "Distribution(Training Dataset)",
     sub = "Ordered by predictor lstat",
     xlab = "Record",
     ylab = "Lower Status(%)")
```

This does not look very linear. Try a simple statistical "transform" to see if we can force it to be more linear.

```{r}
print("Ordered plot of lstat")
plot(sort(log(lstat), decreasing = TRUE),
     main = "Distribution(Training Dataset)",
     sub = "Ordered by predictor lstat",
     xlab = "Record",
     ylab = "log Lower Status(%)")
```

As we're using a linear model, it is important that the variables that are used are pre-processed to be as linear as possible.
